# Python Meshers for Laminated Composite Test-Specimens
Python scripts to automate the meshing of coupons used in the virtual testing of laminated composite materials.

## 1. Open-Hole Specimen 2D
Scripts to generate the in-plane parametrized-meshes of open hole specimens, to be subsequently used in FEA Analysis either with 2D solid or plate/flat-shell elements. 


## 2. Open-Hole Specimen 3D
Scripts to generate parametrized-meshes of laminated open hole specimens with an explicit discretization of the stacking sequence throughout the thickness, for the posterior FEA Analysis with 3D solid elements. 
(To be added soon).

## 3. Dogbone Specimen 2D
(To be added soon).

## 4. Dogbone Specimen 3D
(To be added soon).

## Micro-RVE 3D
(To be added soon).
